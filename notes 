<!-- # simple helo word with html 
# hello world with js  - how the browser understant what is document.create element ? namsthe js --thease are powers that browser already have, browser have js engine which exicute javascript code>
#does the browser understand whats is react when we write react in our code? no we have to get react into our code,
method 1 = cdn - when eput react cdn  browser will understand what is the react , link => its just just a javscript that fb developers build for us , this is react code
console = react = this is coming from the react that we injected using cdn, now we can use react which gives lots of functions and methods that we use 
console = reactdom = this is from react dom which gives lots of functions and mthods from dom manupulation
cdn 1 = core of react all react file
cdn 2 link = dom operation and to modify dom
 now we are goin to use these functions and methods that react and reactdom gives to us this is the way to write react

under the react link in script tag 
we ude document in javascipt here we use react :-

const heading = React.createElement{"h1",{id:name},"helloi word"}core
we need to createRoot 
const root = ReactDom.createRoot(documnet.getElementbyId("root"));
root.render(heading)

reactelement is object, it is the responsiblity of  render method take the object convert it into h1 tag and put it on the dom
reactelement(object) => html(browserunderstand)
now we creating a page to add react = App.js

creating nested structure = to simplify this we use jsx
when there is already have an element in root that will be replaced by the root.render("something")

#pushing our code to git















note :-

react is the ost popular jslibrary to build largescale front end application today
Emmet = is a web development toolkit that enables developers to write html and css code more quikly and efficientle. 
it uses shorthand syntax to expand simple expressions into full-fleged htmlcode.
eg ul>li*5 like this 

cdn condent delevery network = where the react library is hosted , we just fetching that and put into our code using cdn links
